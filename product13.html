            Regular resistance training is associated with better postural alignment and reduced musculoskeletal issues, suggesting strength workouts (including dumbbell and barbell exercises) help support spine posture and overall physical function. |
            Resistance training with weights can significantly reduce spinal curvatures and pelvic tilt, showing measurable improvements in sagittal spine disposition in standing and sitting positions after an 8‑week program compared with control groups (p < 0.001). |
            Strength training enhances trunk stability and core control, which are foundational for spinal support and preventing poor postural collapse during daily activities. |
            Core strengthening exercises improve lumbar joint position sense and postural control, indicating that resistance work that engages the core (as in many dumbbell/barbell lifts) supports better spinal awareness and alignment. |
            Resistance exercise programs significantly decrease back pain and improve functional outcomes, with strength training groups showing up to a 52.5 % reduction in back pain compared with minimal change in control groups, reflecting better support and muscle function around the spine. |
            Targeted strengthening of spinal extensor and stabilizer muscles improves postural alignment and physical performance, showing strength training’s role in maintaining an aligned spine and functional strength.

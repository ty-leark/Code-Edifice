            Pelvic reposition exercises can significantly improve pelvic symmetry, reducing left–right asymmetry in muscle length and movement patterns, which suggests better alignment of the pelvis relative to the body’s axis — a foundation for more neutral spinal posture. |
            Core stability training improves trunk stability and control, enhancing neuromuscular coordination around the pelvis and spine — essential for maintaining neutral spinal alignment against gravitational load. |
            Posterior pelvic tilting increases activation of deep core muscles such as the transversus abdominis, which supports the lumbar spine and lumbopelvic alignment critical to posture and power. |
            Core stability exercises significantly improve static and dynamic postural balance, with measurable improvements in balance tests following stability training, indicating enhanced control over trunk and pelvic positioning. |
            Combined core and pelvic floor training improves lumbar function — a key predictor of reduced lower back strain and better postural support in sedentary populations (e.g., women with lower back pain). |
            Exercise programs targeting pelvic floor and core muscles improve postural control and spinal stability, as discussed in rehabilitation and posture literature, supporting a functional link between pelvic muscle activation and spine alignment.

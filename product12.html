            Deep abdominal training increases thickness of the transversus abdominis, a key core stabilizer that supports trunk stability and postural control during movement. |
            Core stability exercise (including abdominal activation) can improve trunk muscle endurance and reduce stature loss during prolonged sitting, indicating reduced spinal compression and better postural support over time. |
            Core stability training has been shown to significantly improve postural back pain and spinal alignment measures in an 8‑week stabilization program in adults, reflecting improved postural control. |
            Core strength training improves balance ability and functional capacity, both of which underlie spinal support and help maintain upright posture during daily tasks. |
            Deep core exercises activate spinal stabilizing muscles more effectively than some traditional core movements, contributing to enhanced trunk stiffness and control which supports spine posture. |
            Targeted abdominal and core exercises have been linked to reduced musculoskeletal pain and improved functional disability, often tied to better posture and spinal load distribution in those with chronic back issues.

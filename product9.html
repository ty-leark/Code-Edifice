            12 weeks of water bag instability training significantly improved dynamic stability and postural control, including faster walking speed and better single-leg support ability — markers linked with spinal stability and balance. |
            In a randomized trial, water-inertia neuromuscular training significantly improved torso stability and single-leg dynamic balance outcomes (COP distance and RMS), indicating enhanced postural control compared with controls (p < 0.05). |
            Research shows that unstable resistance devices (like water-filled tools) elicit greater core muscle activation than traditional stable loads, improving activation of stabilizers critical for spinal support and postural control. |
            Water-filled training tubes produce greater core muscle activation and demand more postural stability during squats than traditional barbell loads, showing that unstable water loads challenge postural musculature more effectively. |
            Studies of unstable load training suggest that exercises using water inertia enhance stabilizer and antagonist muscle engagement, which contributes to neuromuscular adaptations supporting postural balance and trunk control. |
            Training with water bags improved static stability and reaction times during posture tests compared with baseline, supporting the idea that instability training enhances reflexive postural adjustments — a foundation for maintaining spinal alignment.

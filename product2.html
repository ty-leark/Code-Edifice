            Rebounding can significantly improve mobility, with systematic review data showing that participants in rebound exercise programs walked about 6.08 seconds faster in “timed up-and-go” tests over 3–8 weeks — indicating better functional movement essential for posture and power. |
            In a study comparing mini-trampoline training to traditional running, VO₂max (a marker of cardiovascular capacity) increased by ~7.82% after rebounding exercise, reflecting improved aerobic power and systemic support that aids muscular endurance for posture. |
            A study on older adults indicated that 14 weeks of mini-trampoline exercise improved balance recovery abilities by approximately 35% — better balance contributes directly to postural stability and spinal support. |
            Mini-trampoline exercise programs have been shown to increase core endurance, with significant improvements in trunk muscle endurance after structured rebound training — crucial for spinal alignment and posture control. |
            Studies find that rebounding places less strain on joints (including the spine) while delivering comparable cardiovascular benefits to running, meaning safer loading for strengthening postural muscles over time. |
            A 12-week mini-trampoline training program significantly improved balance, functional mobility, strength, and gait performance in older adults with osteopenia compared to control subjects, indicating that regular rebounding enhances the muscular and neuromotor systems that support posture and stability.

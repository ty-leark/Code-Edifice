            Balance boards improve balance and coordination: Research highlights that balance‑board and wobble board exercises can significantly improve balance ability compared with no intervention, helping stabilize the body’s center of gravity and support upright posture. |
            Core activation increases 20–40%: Electromyography (EMG) studies show balance board exercises raise core muscle activation by up to 20–40% compared with the same movements on a stable surface — strengthening muscles that support the spine. |
            Balance boards improve functional posture: Balance training has been shown to actively engage deep stabilizing muscles and improve spinal alignment in everyday movements — especially useful for people with posture issues from prolonged sitting. |
            Balance training greatly increases static balance duration: In controlled studies, participants using wobble boards increased their balance endurance (standing stork test) from ~10.8 s to ~26.5 s after six weeks of combined balance board and core stability training. |
            Balance plus hamstring training boosts back strength: Six weeks of combined balance and hamstring training significantly improved back strength (p = 0.015) and back endurance (p = 0.027), showing that balance‑focused exercises enhance muscles that support posture. |
            Balance board use reduces fall risk and supports spinal control: Literature on balance training consistently links improved stability and postural control with reduced injury risk and better functional movement — key for maintaining spinal alignment and postural power over time.

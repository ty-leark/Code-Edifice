            Standing and alternating between sitting and standing can reduce back pain — people using sit‑stand desks reported significant decreases in neck, shoulder, and lower back discomfort compared to continuing to sit all day. |
            Using a standing desk improved objective posture metrics — a controlled study showed a significant increase in craniovertebral angle (a marker of better head/neck alignment) in those using a standing desk versus traditional desks (p < 0.05), indicating improved upright posture. |
            Standing desks reduce musculoskeletal strain and fatigue — over a six‑month intervention, participants using adjustable sit‑stand desks reported lower muscle discomfort and post‑work fatigue than those who sat all day. |
            Studies show standing desk users experience large reductions in back pain — some reports indicate back and neck pain reductions of ~32–54% in users after weeks of sit‑stand desk use (reduced upper back and neck pain). |
            Sit‑stand desks decrease prolonged sitting time — research confirms that adjustable desks significantly reduce total time spent sitting during work hours, which is linked to improved physical outcomes such as reduced postural strain. |
            Alternating between sitting and standing increases trunk stability — a study found that a sit‑stand pattern was associated with increased trunk stiffness and reduced back muscle overactivity compared to prolonged sitting, suggesting benefits for spinal support.

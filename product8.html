            Punch bag training increases total biomechanical load on the lumbar region, with heavy bag routines showing higher medial-lateral and vertical load metrics at the lumbar spine than the cervical spine, reflecting engagement of core and trunk muscles under dynamic conditions. |
            Boxing fitness (including bag work) improves balance and posture, as combat-style training improves balance ability, hand-eye coordination, and body rhythm compared to baseline, which supports improved spinal control and upright posture. |
            Throwing punches engages the entire kinetic chain, recruiting legs, hips, core, back, and shoulders together — a full-body movement pattern that builds integrated strength and coordination rather than isolated muscle work. |
            Bag workouts demand controlled rotational movement and core bracing, naturally promoting greater trunk stability and strengthening muscles that support the spine. |
            Core stability training enhances force transfer and postural structure, with research showing integrated core strengthening improves punching power and supports overall structural strength — a 24% improvement in rear-hand punch power after targeted core training, highlighting how core strength enhances power output. |
            Non-contact boxing improves balance and posture mechanisms, with fitness boxing shown to enhance balance reaction and postural control during dynamic movement, which are critical for maintaining spinal alignment in daily activities.

            <h3>RHYTHMIC ALIGNMENT</h3>
            <p>Striking the speed bag enforces an upright stance and rhythmic movement, retraining the spine to stay tall and centered instead of collapsed forward.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="node">
            <h3>SCAPULAR REACTIVATION</h3>
            <p>Rapid punches activate shoulder stabilizers and upper-back muscles weakened by keyboard posture, pulling the shoulders back into alignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="node">
            <h3>CORE-TO-HAND INTEGRATION</h3>
            <p>Every strike transfers force from the feet through the core, rebuilding the kinetic chain that supports spinal stability and efficient posture.</p>

        <div class="node">
            <h3>NEUROMUSCULAR TIMING</h3>
            <p>The speed bag sharpens coordination and timing, improving the nervous system’s ability to maintain balanced posture under continuous demand.</p>
